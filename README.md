# Lung-Cancer-CT-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION



1. Problem Statement
With the increase in the prevalence of cancer, how to detect cancer quickly and accurately become a very important and critical issue. Cancer detection is generally achieved by CT. This project focused on lung cancer lesions. More research needs to be done in order to identify lung cancer. Based on the previous research, we would like to improve previous deep learning models and explore new methods to detect lung cancer. We collected CT images of patients with lung cancer lesions. The lung cancers of these patients are divided into four different types. We used these images and corresponding annotation files to train several deep learning models to classify four types of lung cancers and help to better diagnose lung cancers.


2. Description of Dataset
Our data source is a large-scale CT and PET/CT dataset for lung cancer diagnosis (Lung-PET-CT- Dx)
In the dataset patients with Names/IDs containing the letter 'A' were diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma, 'B' with Small Cell Carcinoma, 'E' with Large Cell Carcinoma, and 'G' with Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Subjects were grouped according to a tissue histopathological diagnosis. The images were acquired from patients with suspicion of lung cancer by using CT and PET-CT.
